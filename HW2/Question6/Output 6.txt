In our class, we talked about how the Scanner class doesn't have a method 
for tokenizing individual characters. But you're hell bent on forcing the 
Scanner class to tokenize the individual characters. What should you set 
your delimiter to?

You can use the string.replace(old char, new char) method and replace any instances of the individual character with a delimiter such as a comma. You can then use the Scanner class delimiter method and set the delimiter to comma to tokenize the individual characters.
